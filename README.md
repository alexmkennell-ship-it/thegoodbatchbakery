# The Good Batch Bakery

A lightweight starter website for a bakery with:

- Menu browsing
- Cart-based ordering flow
- Checkout form that stores submitted orders in `localStorage`
- Customer reviews with ratings, also stored in `localStorage`

## Run locally

Because this is a static site, you can run any local server from the project root.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open <http://localhost:4173>.
